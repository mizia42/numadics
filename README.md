some stuff
#assumptions for the work done
#violation is based on osf flag only. as there is no limit given for speed violation. There is no data given on the connection of harsh acceleration on speed.
@Start time and endtime  :for user with start time and end time it is asked that i display data between this interval .so I am assuming all the data points that start on and after start time and before or on endtime
